I want to play with Redux toolkit bit here by using Names and Jobs comp together, how to dispatch actions nd how to get data from store and all.


Go through Components and Store folder completely


Names comp using useSelector,useDispatch to interact with store

Jobs comp using regular connect function to interact with store


Only bolt i found was i'm unbale to use state in prepare function (prepare callback to add some data to our action coming from comp) ins addName slice.

except this everyting was fine.
